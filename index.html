		<h1>Spherical Voronoi Diagram Pedagogical Aid</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			This webpage will serve as a pedagogical aid for the construction of a Voronoi Diagram
			on a spherical surface. It will show a step-by-step progression of the algorithm that
			computes the result, highlighting the part of the algorithm currently being executed and
			animating the process simultaneously.
		</p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      In a plane, given a set of sites, the Voronoi Diagram is a partition of the plane into
      regions such that the closest site to any given point in a region is the site that lies in
      the same region. In the case of a sphere, the partition would similarly divide the surface
      of the sphere into regions. While the planar version can be used to help you find the nearest
      post office in a city, where the area of the city is approximately flat, the spherical diagram
      can point you to the nearest airport on Earth, since large areas without airports can no
      longer be approximated with a plane.
